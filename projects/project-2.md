Project Description

For my Senior Project (EE 496), I will be creating a Netlogo simulation of people occupying a hospital setting.  My goal with this project is to better understand the motions of nurses, patients, and visitors within a hospital setting in hopes to quantify the spread of infectious diseases between them.  After I make a complete simulation of a time period within the simulation, I plan to insert a transfrer function that will allow people in the simulation to contract and spread a Hospital Associated Infection (HAI) to others based on proximity and exposure time.

Motivation

HAIs are diseases contracted by patients while under medical care.  Sadly, there is no technology right now that allows doctors/nurses to study the spread of HAIs in a hospital setting in real-time.  The best available technology to them is on a day to day resolution.  I hope to create a simulation that closly matches the events of a real hospital to shed some light on how HAIs spread on a smaller time resolution.


I will be making a github page with my Netlogo simulation soon.  It is currently under construction.
