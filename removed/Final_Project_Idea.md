# Overview
The problem with learning a new language in a classroom setting is that students don't have ample opportunities to use it.  On campus, this problem is mitigated through planning International Language Exchanges, which are events where students can meet with other students and practice their use of foreign languages.  While the ILE helps to encourage students to use their foreign language in real-world setting, it isn't enough for students to become comfortable with their communication skills.

Our solution we present is a web application that can provide a means for students to set up their own meetups.  Students can then practice their communication with other students who study the same foreign language.

# Mockup Page Ideas
We would structure the app somewhat like a scheduler.  After a student logs in using their UH Manoa ID, they can build their profile to include their interests and, of course, the foreign language they are looking to practice on.  They can submit times that they are available to meet up with other students, as well as a topic in which they want to talk about.  Students can see on a forum-like page the posts of other students and can arrange meetups through a chat box.

# Use Case Ideas
There are various situations in which this application may be useful for students who seek to practice a language they are learning.

If a student preferred to work at a certain time that is outside of when the International Language Exchange program occurs, he or she may flexibly be able to find a partner or partners at a different time.

If a student felt that the ratio of English speakers to non-English speakers were not balanced enough at the International Language Exchange to get a decent amount of opportunity to converse, this student could find a smaller group to work with using this application.

Some students who attend the ILE program feel the need to have more variety in practice by speaking with different people rather than being stuck in one group for one session at the ILE, so this application would make it possible for such students to find new partners. 

# Beyond The Basics
To add more flexibitly to meeting times, we could implement a video chat option to the application.  This would allow students to practice their foreign language with students across campus or even across countries.
