## Ethics And Programming
Being an ethically sound programmer entails more than just writing code that works.  In my eyes, it's all about taking a step out of the cage that is deadlines and getting code to work.  Taking a step back and reflecting on the potential impacts that your work may have on people other than yourself.  This may include the client, your peers, even your boss.  If you feel at all uneasy about how well your work measures up to your personal morals and ethical standards, it'd be a good idea to talk things over with a trusted collegue.  But, of course, not even my blanket procedure can be enough to solve the many situations that blur the line of what is ethical and what is not.  This is a primary reason for the creation of professional societies and their advocation of ethical standards.

## Association for Computing Machinery
The ACM Code of Ethics provides a set of guidelines that defines ethical conduct for professionals in the software and computer hardware industry.  It is important to note that although most imperatives in the Code of Ethics are no-brainers, such as protecting the privacy of others, some of these imperatives are more subtle and not as intuitive.  One example of this in ACM's Code of Ethics is item number 2.7: Improve public understanding of computing and its consequences.  I wouldn't have thought of this requirement on my own, but fter giving it some thought, I came to believe that this imperative should be required and advocated for (it helps that I am a student in computer engineering).  These types of grey area items on the Code of Ethics are backed by professionals in the society and while they may not be readily intuitive, the ACM can bring about a sort of consensus between software professionals about these ethical standards.
