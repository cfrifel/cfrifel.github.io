## Questions Questions Questions

As a computer engineer, there is no shortage of questions that I have relating to my coursework.  Many of my questions can be answered by searching Google or consulting the textbook.  Easier questions like "why does my code not print out X" can even be answered by simply reviewing the task at hand with a fresh eye.  However, some questions are more difficult and lead me to seek help from my friends and my professor.  Often times these more difficult questions are shared amongst my classmates and by asking them leads to collaboration. When asking questions to my classmates or to my professor, I want to have a clear understanding of my problem so that I can explain my problem concisely.  I also want to have an explaination prepared of what I have looked into to answer my own question.  In general, I want to show that I am competent of my own problem and am ready to receive help from whoever I am asking. These preparations that I take help me ask better questions and allow me to receive good answers.  Had I not taken these steps to prepare my question before asking, it's trivial to think that I would have asked a bad question in its place.  A bad question in this context meaning less-prepared, unintelligent, and unclear.  It is for this reason that asking questions demands the necessary preparation and thought to be considered by others (who know more about the subject then you do) as good ones and worth their time to explain an answer.  To view some examples of good and bad questions, lets look at questions asked on Stack Overflow.

Stack Overflow is a website where people can ask questions and receive help on programming topics.  These questions are answered by skilled programmers who volunteer their time in giving insight to questions for everyone to see.  Stack Overflow tends to be filled with unanswered questions resulting in people being selective in which questions they respond to.  While the majority of questions on Stack Overflow are good questions, there are bad ones that get an appropriate amount of internet flame.

Here is an example of a bad question.  This question can be found on Stack Overflow here.
A bad question
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41753315/how-to-create-a-file-in-c
 - "It just won't work for some reason...I need help." sounds desperate
 - I was able to search his exact title into youtube, and I found countless tutorials 	explaining the process.
 - The tutorials also gave example code for the viewer to follow.  Many of them more complex 	then the snippet of code provided by the asker.

A good question

 - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1704407/what-is-the-difference-between-char-s-and-char-s-in-c
Why is it a good question?
 - The question is simple and straightforward
 - It doesn't feel like a homework problem, it feels genuine even if its a short question
 - The asker gives the answerer a sense of what he wants to get out of his/her answer by stating that he wants to learn more about the differences in memory allocation
 - The asker provides snippets of code to illustrate his question rather than explaining.
 - Although he doesnt state what research he has done into the differences, it was hard for me 	to find an answer to this question after searching google and reading C documentation
