## Roots
I remember playing my first video game on my dad's tower PC when I was just 5 years old.  Even though computers were these very abstract and unintuitive machines to most people, I was using it without a hiccup.  I hadn't memorized the multiplication table yet, which was what part of the game tested me on, and yet I knew how to turn on the computer and access the game I wanted to play.  Computers have always been intuitive to me, that is until I decided to take on a computer engineering degree in college.  Since taking my first course in programming, I have grown leaps and bounds in my understanding of the symphony that is computer hardware and software.

## Where I'm Headed
Through my college projects in engineering, I have come to enjoy working on embedded systems.  Embedded systems are simply computers that people wouldn't normally recognize as a computer, such as the chip in a traffic light.  Programming these systems to be intuitive and "embedded" within the background of our daily lives is the goal and also what I'm looking to turn into a career.


## Software Engineering
From taking a class in software engineering, I want to work with others on a programming assignment to get more familiar with programming in a team environment.  So many of our technologies today are the result of teams of programmers working together, It's paramount that this becomes second nature to me.  Also, I want to engage in athletic programming to help speed up my coding.  I have always had anxiety with short deadlines, but I am always up for throwing myself under the bus if it results self-improvement.
