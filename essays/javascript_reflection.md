The first programming language I learned was C.  Its not everyone's favorite language, but over the years I have become quite good at using C.  Although I have used other languages such as MatLab and Java for specific classes, I keep coming back to C for its barebones simplicity.  Once you get the hang of exactly how precise C requires you to be, C turns out to be very intuitive and straightforward. 

## Javascript

Coming from C, I would describe Javascript as laid-back.  Javascript takes many shortcuts that you would otherwise need to create for yourself in C.  One example of this is that you do not need to specify the data type of a variable at its instantiation. One can simple assign their desired string or number value to a variable and the language will hide the complexities in the background.  I welcome this method of declaring my variable, but to a beginning programmer this may create problems when trying to learn a language that doesn't take care of these complexities, like C.

Overall, I like Javascript for its simplicity and being intuitive.  The syntax is very similar to Java and C and through doing the practice problems on freecodecamp, I was able to quickly apply algorithms which I used for C.  I think my biggest problem lies in the fact that I am so used to constructing my own functions that I will forget to use the built in functions that Javascript has to offer.  Using the built in functions can help me code faster as well as simplify my code for other to view.

## Athletic Programming

Honestly, while I found the practice WODs to be helpful in timing my programming skills, time limits, especially short ones, give me anxiety and cause my code to falter.  With more practice and throwing myself under the bus, I hope to see vast improvements in my coding prowess under pressure.

Because I have extensive practice with C, I am already familiar with basic and advanced algorithms.  This has lead to me slipping up on syntax several times during both practice and in-class WODs.  For example, during the first in-class WOD I was unable to spot a small syntax error even though I had finished the algorithm within the first 3 minutes and therefore Did Not Finish (DNF).  I hope to become more familiar with javascript syntax so that I can go from using Javascript and C without any syntax hiccups.
