Back in grade school, I used to swim for both a club swimming team and my local high school swim team.  I remember being put through rigorous training to become a competitive, often challenging my audacity and sanity.  These past few weeks that I spent learning the basics of Meteor reminded me of those swimming days, in both the intensity and the number of headaches I have received thus.  But, there was one other aspect of swimming that I noticed shared closely with Meteor development.

You are probably wondering what swimming has in common with using Meteor.  To swim any stroke, a person must use their arms, legs, hips, and other parts of their body at the same time.  Only with a precisely coordinated movement of a person’s whole body are they able to move effectively through the water.  The result of a good swimmer using their entire body to propel themselves forward in the water is a look of effortless fluidity.

Meteor is essential relies on the same principle.  In make a beautiful and functional application, Meteor demands that its developers use multiple programming tools at the same time.  JavaScript, Semantic-UI, HTML, ESLint, and MongoDB must all be used in a coordinated and orchestrated fashion to create a quality web application.  And, of course, if the developer should be lacking in any one of these programming skills, the results are immediate and affect not just the part of the application where the skill is applied, but the application as a whole.
